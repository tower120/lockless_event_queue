This branch should implement SBO for EventQueue. SmallChunk's not implemented yet.
Should look like this:

type Event = EventQueue<
    MyMessage,
    8/*SMALL_CHUNK_SIZE*/,
    2/*SMALL_CHUNKS_COUNT*/,
    512/*BIG_CHUNK*/,
    true/*AUTO_CLEANUP*/
>;


let event = Event::new();

let reader1 = EventReader::new(event);
let reader2 = EventReader::new(event);

let event = unsafe{Pin::new_unchecked(&event)};

for message in reader1.iter(event){}


reader1.unsubscribe(event);
reader2.unsubscribe(event);


All Reader functions now require pinned EventQueue. So you must guarantee that Event will
not be moved during reader operations. Must be manually unsubscribed.
